DOM, also known as Document Object Model, is an object created by the browser to represent the html it's currently displaying. 

It allows javascript to manipulate the html it represents in order to interact with it. Now what does this mean? 

It means that in order for javascript to actually do anything in a website, the browser needs to build something that it can touch.

Imagine creating a blueprint on a construction site. Everything is written on paper (HTML). 

If a interior designer (javascript) comes along and decides that they wanted to change certain things like the color of the wall or 

have the furniture be placed a certain way, it would be somewhat difficult for them to do. Now along comes a construction company or 

a modeling company (browser). They would create a 3D model of the blueprint's specifications or outright build the property. 

Now the designer can do it's work to interact with the infrastructure.
